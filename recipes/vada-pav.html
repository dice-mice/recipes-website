        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Vadapav is a vegetarian fast food dish native to the state of
          Maharashtra. The dish consists of a deep fried potato dumpling placed
          inside a bread bun (pav) sliced almost in half through the middle. It
          is generally accompanied with one or more chutneys and a green chili
          pepper.

          <h4>Steps</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Boil 2 large potatoes that weigh about 350 grams. Peel and then
              mash them with a fork in a bowl.<br />
              You can boil or steam the potatoes in a pan, Instant pot or
              pressure cooker. Remember to drain the water very well from the
              boiled potatoes before you mash them.<br />
              Also crush 6 to 7 small/medium-sized garlic cloves and 1 to 2
              green chilies in a mortar pestle.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat 2 to 3 teaspoons of oil in a small pan. Add ½ a teaspoon of
              mustard seeds and crackle them. Then add 7 to 8 curry leaves and a
              pinch of asafoetida (hing). Stir and sauté for about 5 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the crushed garlic cloves and green chilies mixture to the
              pan. Add ⅛ teaspoon of turmeric powder (about 2 to 3 pinches).
            </li>
            <li>
              Stir for some seconds or until the raw aroma of garlic goes away.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour this tempering mixture together with the oil to the mashed
              potatoes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves and salt as
              required.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mix everything well. Then make small to medium balls from the
              mashed potato mixture. Flatten these balls a bit. Cover and keep
              aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              In another bowl, make a smooth batter from 1 to 1.25 cups besan
              (gram flour), ⅛ teaspoon turmeric powder (about 2 to 3 pinches), a
              pinch of asafoetida (hing), a pinch of baking soda (optional),
              salt and ½ cup water or as needed<br />The batter should have a
              medium-thick flowing consistency. It should not be too thick or
              thin. If the batter becomes thin, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of gram
              flour. If the batter becomes thick, then add 1 or 2 tablespoons of
              water.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dip the slightly flattened potato balls in the batter and coat it
              evenly with the batter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Before you dip the batata vada in the batter, heat oil in a pan or
              wok (kadai). When the oil becomes hot then dip the batata vada in
              the batter to coat as shown in the above steps.
              <br />
              Carefully and gently drop these batter coated potato balls in
              medium hot oil.
              <br />
              Note: You can read more details on the frying temperature in the
              ‘expert tips’ section below.
            </li>
            <li>
              Depending on the size of the kadai or pan, you can add more or
              less of the vada while frying. But don’t overcrowd the pan
            </li>
            <li>
              When one side firms up, becomes slightly crisp and golden then
              only turn over gently with a slotted spoon. Fry the second side.
              This way deep fry them till golden, turning a couple of times as
              needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drain them on kitchen paper towels. Make all batata vada this way
              and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              Serve them when they are still hot or warm. Put all the chutneys
              and pav on your work surface. Slice the pav without breaking it
              into two parts and set aside.
              <br />
              If you don’t have sweet chutney, then make the vada pav with green
              chutney. The green chutney and sweet chutney recipes are in the
              recipe card below.
              <br />
              You can make these two chutney recipes some hours ahead or a day
              before and refrigerate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spread both the green chutney and sweet chutney on the sliced pav.
              You can also spread green chutney on one side and sweet chutney on
              the other side.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sprinkle the dry garlic chutney on the pav. This step is optional
              and you can skip it if you don’t have garlic chutney.
            </li>
            <li>Place the hot batata vada in the bread slices.</li>
            <li>
              Serve vada pav immediately or else the pav becomes soggy. You can
              also serve some salted fried green chilies and both of the
              chutneys with it.
              <br />
              It makes for a good filling evening snack high on carbs. A cup of
              hot tea or coffee can also be served as a side beverage.
