          <h4>Steps</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Rinse 2 cups of coriander leaves well in water. Drain the water
              and roughly chop them. Take all the ingredients listed below in a
              blender.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add 1 or 2 teaspoons water and grind to a smooth chutney. Add a
              few teaspoons more of the water if required. But don’t make the
              chutney too thin or runny.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove the chutney in a bowl and set aside. Cover and refrigerate
              if making sev puri after some hours or next day.
            </li>
            <li>
              Break and deseed 15 to 16 dry Kashmiri red chilies. Soak the red
              chilies in hot water for about 20 to 30 minutes. The water just
              needs to cover them. Peel and roughly chop 8 to 9 medium garlic
              cloves.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drain all the water from the red chilies after 20 to 30 minutes.
              Add the red chillies, garlic and salt according to taste in a
              blender or grinder.
              <br />
              Adding very little water grind or blend both the red chilies and
              garlic until smooth. The consistency of the chutney should be more
              towards thicker side or of medium consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour the red chilli garlic chutney in a small jar or bowl. Cover
              and refrigerate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rinse ½ cup tamarind (remove seeds if any) in a strainer. In a
              pan, take the tamarind, ½ cup dates (seedless or pitted) and 2
              cups water.
              <br />
              Cook the tamarind and dates for about 8 to 9 minutes on a low heat
              or until they soften.
            </li>
            <li>
              When the tamarind and dates have softened, add ½ cup of powdered
              or chopped jaggery and continue to cook. Let the jaggery dissolve
              completely and the mixture thicken a bit.
              <br />
              Swap ½ cup of sugar with jaggery if you do not have jaggery.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add all the spice powders – ¼ to ½ teaspoon red chili powder or
              cayenne, ½ teaspoon coriander powder, ½ teaspoon dry ginger powder
              (ground ginger) and ½ teaspoon roasted cumin powder.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mix well and simmer for a further 1 to 2 minutes more. Season with
              salt according to taste. Let the chutney mixture cool at room
              temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a chutney grinder or small blender, grind this whole mixture
              until smooth. Add some water if needed while blending or grinding.
              Strain the chutney through a strainer if desired.
              <br />
              Store the tamarind date chutney in an airtight bowl or container
              in the refrigerator and use it when you make chaat at home.
              <br />
              This recipe will give you a bowl of thick tamarind chutney, which
              you can easily refrigerate for a month or freeze for 2 to 3
              months.
